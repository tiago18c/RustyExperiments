# RustyExperiments
In this repo I will share my learning experience and projects with Rust.
It all started after a month and half developing Solnet, I got curious and decided I wanted to give Rust a try before the end of the year. 3 hours later I found myself installing the toolchain.


# Projects

## Hello world

You really can't start a neww lang without the good ol' Hello World, can you?

## Game of life

This was the second project. In hindsight it was a bit of a mistake. Having college experience with C, and professional experience with C++, Java and .NET (mostly the last two) and coming to Rust was a big shock in regards to syntax and resource management.
I have to say that the compiler is a refreshing experience. Even coming from .NET, the suggestions are very helpful for a newbie who is trying to learn.

During this project I also realised that I had installed the wrong VSCode extension (or at least not the best one). After finishing the code and a bit of googling I found the extension 'matklad.rust-analyzer' and it is a godsend (don't forget your Cargo.toml, otherwise no dice).
